The reality is that "dungeon" could be anything and "room" is just a "scene", so this structure can be used to anything. From a town exploration, a politic intrigue to a real dungeon.

1. entrance
2. puzzle
3. set back
4. climax
5. resolution



set a theme (goblin dungeon, orc, cobold with little dragon, a counselor that want to set back a king, etc...)


1. answer: "why this dungeon is not looted already?"
2. encounter to move the story (opposite encounter than the entrance, if entrance was a combat, this must be a riddle and vice-versa)
3. reveal the truth of the dungeon story, hinder the heroes's progression and burn heroe's resources
4. Boss battle, that's it
5. Reward or plot twist (maybe a reward guarded from a last trap or combat). It's the occasion to bind this dungeon to a sequent adventure
